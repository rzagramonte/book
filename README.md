# Book
Book brings people together through a shared love of reading, with real-time group formation, collaborative book selection, and AI-enhanced discussion. After taking a short quiz, users are matched into color-coded reading groups based on reading style. From there, AI recommends books tailored to the group’s “reader color,” helping them choose a title together. During discussions, group members can submit their own prompts to the AI to ask for literary analysis to diving into characters, themes, or writing style. With a vibrant landing page, clear onboarding, and a thoughtful community angle, Book makes discovering your next read effortless and meaningful.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, Daisy UI, Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Django ORM, Cloudinary, and the Hugging Face API  

I’m currently rebuilding Foodship as Book, a reading community platform that brings people together through real-time group formation, collaborative book selection, and AI-assisted discussion. I’ve kept the original foundation—responsive design, real-time chat via Socket.IO, and event scheduling—while layering in new features like user-generated AI prompts and tailored book recommendations based on group “reader colors.” This rebrand not only updates the mission but also gives me space to deepen my skills in Python, SQL, and React as I flip the stack.

## Optimizations

In a future phase, I plan to enhance Book’s performance and overall user experience. This will include optimizing images, implementing lazy loading for key assets, and streamlining the codebase to reduce load times. I also aim to audit and improve accessibility and responsiveness across devices, ensuring the platform is fast, intuitive, and inclusive for every reader.

## Lessons Learned:

While Book is still in its early stages, building Foodship laid the foundation for my approach to full-stack development. I learned how to bring frontend and backend systems together to support real-time communication, group formation, and event flow. Those experiences taught me the value of clean UI, thoughtful UX, and modular architecture — lessons I’m now applying as I reimagine the platform with a new focus and updated tech stack.
